LIME is a online tool that calculates the mass loss rate at the critical point using CAK theory. 
It also calculates the line force parameters at the critical point using the "Munich Atomic Database"
The major advantage of LIME is that it does not depend on any underlying grid to calculate mass loss rates. 
The user can also change the default abundances to any values and calculate the massloss rates
